## Architecture
Architecture that is meticulously planned is paramount for an application's scalability, and all architectural designs share a universal aim - to handle the complexity of your application. This might not be a concern for smaller-scale apps, but it can be incredibly advantageous when working on apps with an extended development timeline and a bigger team.

Robert C. Martin introduced the concept of Clean Architecture in 2012 via the Clean Code Blog, and it abides by the SOLID principle.

## Layers

### Project Structure
<p align="start"><img src="https://github.com/luisfagundes94/parrot/blob/master/screenshots/projectStructure.png?raw=true" alt="Project Structure" width="500"></p>

### Commons
The ```commons``` layer is responsible for common properties. It contains the implementations of the resources files, themes and components declared in the common layer.

- __testing__: This is responsible for common testing rules.
- __ui__: Has common UI components across the app.
- __theme__: Defines themes, colors, fonts and resource files.
- __util__: Mainly for storing global constants.

### Data
The ```data``` layer is responsible for selecting the proper data source for the domain layer. It contains the implementations of the repositories declared in the domain layer.

### Domain
This is the core layer of the application. The ```domain``` layer is independent of any other layers thus ] domain business logic can be independent from other layers.This means that changes in other layers will have no effect on domain layer eg.  screen UI (presentation layer) or changing database (data layer) will not result in any code change withing domain layer.

### Presentation
The ```features``` layer contains components involved in showing information to the user. The main part of this layer are the views(activity, compose) and ViewModels.

### Framework
The ```framework``` layer is responsible for core functionalities, such as model for network responses, extensions, and base classes.

### Plugins
The ```plugins``` layer is responsible for dependency management. It control and manage all dependencies in one place with Kotlin using the Gradle Version Catalog.
